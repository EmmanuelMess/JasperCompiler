Jasper is "a scripting language inspired by Haskell, Javascript, and modern C++. Jasper can be embedded in C++ applications", 
it was made by [SebastianMestre et al.](https://github.com/SebastianMestre/Jasper/graphs/contributors) the official
interpreter is [here](https://github.com/SebastianMestre/Jasper). This project is not 
endorsed by any of the contributors of the official Jasper repo.

## [in the future] Flex and Bison

[Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex) and [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) are the lexer and parser 
respectively for this project.

## LLVM

The idea is to use the [LLVM IR](https://www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html) to compile the program into an executable.
